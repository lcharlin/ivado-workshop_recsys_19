    "\n",
    "We assume that the user already has an understanding of the basic concepts that underlie the field. We review both methodological concepts like supervised and unsupervised learning, and also use software libraries such as scikit-learn, pandas, and numpy. \n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, we will:\n",
    "1. load some data, \n",
    "2. fit different supervised models on variations of the data, including a variation where some of the features have been clustered, \n",

    "### Section 0. Introduction\n",
    "As the introduction to a recommender-systems workshop we will model user-movie preferences from a popular publicly available dataset (Movielens 1M). We will learn, from past user-movie ratings, to predict (missing/future) user-movie ratings from user socio-demographics and movie-tags data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically, we are interested in learning the (parameters of the) following function: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ r_{um} = f_\\theta(x_u, x_m)$$ \n",
    "where \n",
    "- $u$ indexes users \n",
    "- $m$ indexes items\n",
    "- $r_{um}$ is u's rating for m (that user's preference) -- the dependent variable\n",
    "- $f_\\theta$ is some model parametrized by $\\theta$. For example, a linear regression with coefficients $\\theta$\n",
    "- $x_u$ are user u's covariates (e.g., age and occupation of this user)\n",
    "- $x_m$ are movie m's covariates (e.g., tags associated with the movie)\n",
    "\n",
    "The function $f$ can take several forms (in other words, we can use a variety of models for this task). In today's tutorial we will assume that the problem is a regression one and we will experiment with several models ranging from a simple linear regression model to a more complicated two-hidden layer neural network.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Machine Learning terminology\n",
    "\n",
    "It can be useful to think of machine learning as comprising three elements:\n",
    "1. Task (T)\n",
    "2. Experience (E)\n",
    "3. Performance measure (P).\n",
    "\n",
    "(a good description of these concepts is provided in [Ch. 5 of the Deep Learning Book](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/contents/ml.html))\n",
    "\n",
    "The intuition is that the task (T) is \"the type of problem you are trying the solve\" (e.g., classification, regression, anomaly detection), the experience (E) is \"how your data comes about\" (e.g., does it come with labels or not, do you observe it all at once or as a stream), and the performance (P) is \"how well your model does\". Standard performance measures include accuracy and mean squared error.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the above terminology does not define the model used to learn (fit) the data nor does it define the fitting procedure (e.g., gradient descent).\n",
    "\n",
    "Relationship to the problem of rating prediction:\n",
    "- Task: Our task is to predict user-movie ratings. It can be modelled in different ways (more on this tomorrow), but here we will model it as a regression problem. \n",
    "- Experience: The experience is a supervised learning one because we are predicting some dependent variable (rating) from a set of independent variables\n",
    "- Performance measure: We will be using the mean-squared error.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setting up the data \n",
    "\n",
    "For supervised learning, it is customary, to construct two data matrix $X$ and $Y$. The former, $X$, contains the covariates (features). It is a matrix of size $n \\times p$ with $n$ the number of examples and $p$ the dimensionality of each example (in other words the number of covariates associated with each example).  They are the input to the function. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$X = \\begin{bmatrix} \n",
    "x_{11} & x_{12} & \\ldots & x_{1p} \\\\\n",
    "\\vdots & \\ddots       &  \\ddots      & \\vdots \\\\ \n",
    "x_{n1} & x_{12} & \\ldots & x_{np} \\\\\n",
    "\\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "The latter, $Y$, is a (column) vector of length $n$ which contains the labels (here ratings). $Y_1$ corresponds to the rating of $X_1$ (row  contains the labels (here ratings).\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Y = \\begin{bmatrix} \n",
    "r_1 \\\\\n",
    "r_2 \\\\\n",
    "\\vdots \\\\ \n",
    "r_n\n",
    "\\end{bmatrix}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, in a real problem we will differentiate the `train` and `test` sets, e.g., with $X_\\text{train}$ and $X_\\text{test}$. Same for the labels using, e.g., $Y_\\text{train}$ and $Y_\\text{test}$."

    "There are over 900 tags but most movies only contain a handful of tags (see above). In other words, tag representations for each movie (and equivalently for ratings) will be very sparse. For a given example, most covariates will be zero. \n",
    "\n",
    "This presents two challenges for machine learning methods: \n",
    "- We will need many parameterrs since we need one per tag, so 900 parameters for tags\n",
    "- Each parameter will only be trained with a small number of data points which could make its estimation imprecise.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several ways to deal with this. One is to use an $L1$ penalty on the weights (more details [Lasso w. sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/linear_model.html#lasso)), this is useful for the first challenge. Another is to reduce the dimensionality of the tag representation (initially 900). The intuition would be to capture dependencies between different tags and to use these dependencies to re-encode the tags of each movie using a lower-dimensional representation. \n",

    "Again, there are several ways of doing this. Here, we will use clustering. Clustering **groups** each data into a fixed number of groups. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, we first we cluster movies according to their tags. Then, we use the cluster of each movie as the covariate (instead of, or in addition to, the original representation). If there are 10 clusters, then we would reduce the dimensionality of the tag covariates from 900 to 10.\n",

    "#### Clustering in scikit-learn\n",
    "\n",
    "Scikit-learn proposes several clustering routines. Below we try three different ones. Before going into their details, let us first consider how to train a model using `scikit-learn`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Most models are trained in two steps:\n",
    "1. instantiate the object: `model = sklearn.GreatModel(...)`)\n",
    "2. Fit the object to data: `model.fit(X_train,Y_train)`\n",
    "\n",
    "once the model is fit, it can be used to make predictions for missing data\n",
    "3. Predict: `y_pred = model.predict(X_test)`\n",
    "\n",
    "This API makes it very simple and efficient to experiment with different models in scikit-learn. As soon as the data is processed in a correct way, different methods can be easily compared.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Below we experiment with three different clustering models: \n",
    "1. [KMeans](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/clustering.html#k-means): One of the standard clustering algorithms (it can be seen as a special case of other clustering techniques such as clustering using GMMs). It learns where to place *cluster centers* to best represent the data. A datum belongs to the cluster center that it is the closest to. When fitting, the objective is to minimize the sum of the distances between each datum and its center. This particular technique can be fit on large datasets but assumes Euclidean distances.  \n",
    "2. [Agglomerative Clustering](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/clustering.html#hierarchical-clustering). This is an instance of hierarchical clustering. In hierarchical clustering, points are recursively agglomerated (i.e., it goes from one cluster per point, to $n-1$ clusters, to $n-2$ clusters and so on) until a set number of clusters has been attained. Compared to KMeans, the distance metric and the objective can be altered to take into account different types of spaces.\n",
    "3. [Affinity Propagation (AP)](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/clustering.html#affinity-propagation): Provides a third methodology for clustering. Unlike Kmeans which uses cluster centers (agglomerative clustering does something similar implicitly), AP uses available data points as cluster centers, these are called *examplars*. Further, AP determines automatically the number of clusters for a dataset. In AP each datum sends messages to all other data. The messages contain information about the affinity for one datum to be the examplar for the other. The procedure is iterative and eventually converges to a clustering of all data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How do you evaluate clustering\n",
    "\n",
    "Unsupervised learning is ill-defined in that there is no objective measure of performance. For example, in clustering, different algorithms can optimize different losses and will yield different results. Different clusterings will then meet different desiderata and can be used under different scenarios. If data exploration is the goal, then having explainable clusters will make the most sense. If, on the other hand, the goal is to use the output into a downstream supervised model then the performance of that model can server as an indication of the quality of the clusters. \n",
    "\n",
    "In our problem we want to cluster movie represented by their tags: sparse binary vectors. It may make sense to use a [Hamming or L1 loss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_distance) then a euclidean loss. We will see below that the results are actually quite robust regardless of which loss we use."

    "- This empirical distribution looks symmetrical so there doesn't seem to be a bias toward lower or higher predictions\n",
    "- The prediction errors seem to show that movies and users with more data have smaller prediction error (i.e., the data forms a \"triangle\" pointing to the right, this is much clearer when running w. more training data which we limit here to save time). This is intuitive, the more data you have about an item the more accurate should be the estimation of its parameters ($\\theta_{\\text{mid}}$). This could also be reinforced by the fact that we are splitting ratings randomly for train and test (versus splitting by user or item). Hence, popular movies and high-activity users have a great influence in the learning process."

So the tags do seem to provide slightly better test performance at the expense of a slightly larger model (968 extra parameters to fit) which takes about 30% longer to fit. Take this with a grain of salt because it is hardware dependent. But, this hints at the fact that the fitting algorithm is not linear (i.e., increasing the number of parameters by 10% yields an increase of 30% in running time).\n",

    "- A neural network is made up of interconnected *neurons*. Each neuron computes a few simple operations. \n",
    "- In a *feed-forward network*, neurons are organized into sets called *layers*. \n",
    " - Neurons in each layer get their inputs from the previous layer and send their outputs to the next layer. \n",
    " - The first layer is called the *input layer* it provides data to the next layer. The last layer is the *output layer* it provides a prediction $\\hat{y}$. \n",
    " - Layers in between the input layer and the output layer are called *hidden layers*. Each neuron in the hidden layers is a linear regression model followed by a non-linear function (*activation function*): $f(x) = \\sum_i x_i \\theta_i$. \n",
    "  - While the number of neurons in the input and output layers are fixed by the data (the number of features and the number of predictions). \n",
    "  - The number of neurons of a hidden layer is a hyperparameter. Another hyperparameter is the number of hidden layers. \n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically for a regression task (with a single output), a one-hidden layer neural net is: \n",
    "$$ \n",
    "f(x) = f_\\text{o} ( \\sum_{j=0}^{|\\text{hidden n.}|} \\theta'_{j} f_\\text{h}( \\sum_{i=0}^{|p|}\\theta_{ij} x_i ) ) \n",

    "- $f_h$ is the activation function of the hidden layer\n",
    "- $\\theta'_{j}$ are the parameters that connect the neuron $j$ in the hidden layer to the output layer.\n",
    "- $f_o$ is the activation function of the output layer\n",

    "- Here we use the same L2-penalty regularizer on all parameters. The strength of this regularizer is given by $\\alpha$. \n",
    "- In addition, we use a second regularizer called `early-stopping`. Learning the parameters of a neural network is done iteratively using a method called gradient descent (as opposed to linear regression, there is not analytical solution for the parameters given the objective function). Early stopping simply evaluates validation error after each iteration. It stops learning when validation error stops improving. This can happen before the training loss converges. When it does not, then this regularizer has no effect on learning. In `scikit-learn`, the MLPRegressor class with `early_stopping=True` automatically splits a validation set from the training set to be used by this regularizer. The disadvantage, of course, is that this reduces the amount of data used to fit parameters. \n",

    "### Section 3. Concluding Remarks\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this tutorial was to put in practice some of the principles that were discussed in this morning's presentation but also to make you start thinking about recommender systems data. We will of course spend a lot of time in the next couple of days thinking about preference data including where it's coming from and how to model it. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here are a few more parting thoughts: \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "As you might have noticed, applied machine learning is a very empirical endeavour. Once you have data in the right format, it is typical to fit it using several models, each time trying to understand the advantages/disadvantages of each model and getting a more thorough understanding of the data. In practice, this last part may be crucial and we did not adress this last part much in this tutorial (instead focussing on the models themeselves).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Scikit-learn\n",
    "`scikit-learn` is a powerful ML library. It is meant as a model (and data pre-processing) toolbox. It provides an interface to a wide variety of models, it is actively developped, and in general seen as a very good plateform. It is also open source and free to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Model Selection, i.e., which model should I use for a particular dataset/task can be daunting. [This page](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/machine_learning_map/index.html) provides some tips particular to `scikit-learn`. In general, when working on a new task/dataset it is often useful to try and compare different models. Remember that in practice (mean) test-performance is only one of the possible desiderata (others include running time both for training and other metrics like false positive rates).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that `scikit-learn` does not fit every use case. For example, its support of modern neural networks is fairly modest. It is also not meant as a development plateform for new models.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Other packages\n",
    "\n",
    "Software is one of the reasons behind the rise of modern machine learning. Modern software automatize a number of tasks which allow programmers and researchers alike to be much more efficient. `scikit-learn` is one popular package for fitting machine learning models but there exist others (both applied and also for exploration/development purposes). All in all, it can be useful to know about these packages but (in my opinion) it is more useful to have a good understanding of the fundamentals of the field as the package landscape changes rapidly and one can always learn one more. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Food for thought\n",
    " - In our models we assumed that ratings were the dependent variable (y) and that we had covariates (e.g., features of users and movies). Imagine a setting where we don't have any features or, somewhat equivalently, had features that were not predictive of ratings. In that case the linear regression model would be: \n",
    " \n",
    "$$\n",
    "f(x_{ui}) = \\theta_\\text{uid} x_{\\text{uid}_u} + \\theta_{\\text{mid}} x_{\\text{mid}_i}\n",
    "$$ \n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    "- **Question 6:** What's wrong with the above model? Try to think about it for a minute or two before looking at the answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- As we will see tomorrow, many models take ratings as output **and** as input. For example, one could take a user's previous ratings and try to predict one's future ratings (for example using an auto-encoder model). This is a nice way to build models that do not require any user/item covariates (and these models can also be extended when that data exist)."
