    "=============\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial provides a short introduction to the practice of machine learning. We assume that the user already has an understanding of the basics. We review both methodological concepts like supervised and unsupervised learning, and also use software libraries such as scikit-learn, pandas, and numpy. In particular, we will load some data, fit different supervised models on the variations of the data, including a variation where some of the features have been clustered, and compare results. \n",

    "### Context\n",
    "As the introduction to a recommender-systems workshop we will model user-movie preferences from a popular publically available dataset (Movielens 1M). We will learn to predict user-movie ratings from user socio-demographics and movie-tags data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically, we are interested in learning the (parameters of the) following function: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ r_{um} = f_\\theta(x_u, x_m)$$ \n",
    "where \n",
    "- $u$ indexes users \n",
    "- $m$ indexes items\n",
    "- $r_{um}$ is u's rating for m (that user's preference). That's the dependant variable\n",
    "- $f_\\theta$ is some model parametrized by $\\theta$. For example a linear regression with coefficients $\\theta$\n",
    "- $x_u$ are user u's covariates (e.g., age and occupation of this user)\n",
    "- $x_m$ are movie m's covariates (e.g., tags associated with the movie)\n",
    "\n",
    "The exact form of the function $f$ is left unspecified. In today's tutorial, we will try several ones from a simple linear regression model to a more complicated one-hidden layer neural network.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Machine Learning terminology\n",
    "\n",
    "It can be useful to think of machine learning as comprising of three elements:\n",
    "1. Task (T)\n",
    "2. Experience (E)\n",
    "3. Performance measure (P).\n",
    "\n",
    "(a good description of these concepts is provided in [Ch. 5 of the Deep Learning Book](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/contents/ml.html))\n",
    "\n",
    "The intuition is that the task (T) is the type of problem you are trying the solve (e.g., classification, regression, anomaly detection), the experience (E) is how your data comes about (e.g., does it come with labels or not, do you observe it all at once or as a stream), and the performance (P) is \"how well your model does\". Standard performance measure include accuracy and mean squared error.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the above terminology does not define the model used to learn (fit) the data nor does it define the fitting procedure (e.g., gradient descent).\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the above: \n",
    "- Task: Today the task is to predict user-movie ratings. It can be modelled in different ways (more on this next tomorrow), but to begin we will model it as a regression problem. \n",
    "- Experience: The experience is a supervised learning one because we are predicting some dependant variable (rating) from a set of independant variables\n",
    "- Performance measure: We will be using the mean-squared error.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setting up the data \n",
    "\n",
    "For supervised learning, it is customary, to construct two data matrix $X$ and $Y$. The former, $X$ contains the covariates (features). It is a matrix of size $n \\times p$ with $n$ the number of examples and $p$ the dimensionality of each example (in other words the number of covariates associated with each example).  They are the input to the function. The latter, $Y$ is a (column) vector of length $n$ which contains the labels (here ratings). $Y_1$ corresponds to the rating of $X_1$ (row  contains the labels (here ratings).\n",
    "\n",
    "$$X = \\begin{bmatrix} \n",
    "x_{11} & x_{12} & \\ldots & x_{1p} \\\\\n",
    "\\vdots & \\ddots       &  \\ddots      & \\vdots \\\\ \n",
    "x_{n1} & x_{12} & \\ldots & x_{np} \\\\\n",
    "\\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "\\;\\;\\;\\;\n",
    "Y = \\begin{bmatrix} \n",
    "r_1 \\\\\n",
    "r_2 \\\\\n",
    "\\vdots \\\\ \n",
    "r_n\n",
    "\\end{bmatrix}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, in a real problem we will differentiate the `train` and `test` sets with $X_\\text{train}$ and $X_\\text{test}$. Same with labels data using $Y_\\text{train}$ and $Y_\\text{test}$."

For example, here each tag has an numerical index (e.g., tag `scary` is id `882`) but tags cannot be compared using their numbers (e.g., tag `882` is not \"bigger\" than tag `880` or smaller than tag `900`). 1-of-K encoding deals with this by encoding each tag as a binary vector of length $K$ with a single non-zero value which corresponds to the tags. In the present case, $K=968$ tags, and tag `scary` would have a `1` at position `882`. \n",

    "# Section 1.1 Tag clustering\n",
    "\n",
    "There are over 900 tags but most movies only contain a handful of tags (see above). In other words, tag representations for each movie (and equivalently for ratings) will be very sparse. For a given example, most covariates will be zero. \n",
    "\n",
    "This presents two challenges for machine learning methods: \n",
    "- We will need one parameter for each tag (so 900 parameters for tags)\n",
    "- Each parameter will only be trained with a small number of data points which could make its estimation inprecise.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are sever ways to deal with this. One is to use an $L1$ penalty on the weights (more details (here)[]). Another is to reduce the dimensionality of the tag representation. The intuition would be to capture dependancies between different tags and to use these dependancies to re-encode the tags of each movie using a lower-dimensional representation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Again, there are several ways of doing this. Here, we will use clustering. Clustering **groups** each data into a fixed number of groups. \n",

    "#### Clustering in scikit-learn\n",
    "\n",
    "Scikit-learn proposes several clustering routines. Below we try three different ones. Before going into their details, let us first consider how to train a model using `scikit-learn`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Most models are trained in two steps:\n",
    "1. instantiate the object: `model = sklearn.GreatModel(...)`)\n",
    "2. Fit the object to data: `model.fit(X_train,Y_train)`\n",
    "\n",
    "once the model is fit, it can be used to make predictions for missing data\n",
    "3. Predict: `y_pred = model.predict(X_test)`\n",
    "\n",
    "This API makes it very simple and efficient to experiment with different models in scikit-learn. As soon as the data is processed in a correct way, different methods can be easily compared.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Below we experiment with three different clustering models: \n",
    "1. [KMeans](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/clustering.html#k-means): One of the standard clustering algorithms (it can be seen as a special case of other clustering techniques such as clustering using GMMs). It learns where to place *cluster centers* to best represent the data. A datum belongs to the cluster center that it is the closest to. When fitting, the objective is to minimize the sum of the distances between each datum and its center. This particular technique can be fit on large datasets but assumes euclidean distances.  \n",
    "2. [Agglomerative Clustering](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/clustering.html#hierarchical-clustering). This is an instance of hierarchical clustering. In hierarchical clustering, points are recursively agglomerated (i.e., it goes from one cluster per point, to $n-1$ clusters, to $n-2$ clusters and so on) until a a pre-fixed number of clusters has been attained. Compared to KMeans, the distance metric and the objective can be altered to take into account different types of spaces.\n",
    "3. [Affinity Propagation (AP)](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/clustering.html#affinity-propagation): Provides a third type of methodology for clustering. Unlike Kmeans which uses cluster centers (aglomerative clustering does something similar implicitely), AP available data points as cluster centers, these are called *examplars*. Further, AP determines automatically the number of clusters for a dataset. In AP each datum sends messages to all other data. The messages contain information about the affinity for one datum to be the examplar for the other. The procedure is iterative and eventually converges to a clustering of all data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How do you evaluate clustering\n",
    "\n",
    "Unsupervised learning is ill-defined in that there is no objective measure of performance. For example, in clustering, different algorithms can optimize different losses and will yield different results. Different clusterings will then meet different desiderata and can be used under different scenarios. If data exploration is the goal, then having explanable clusters will make the most sense. If on the other hand the goal is to use the output into a downstream supervised model then the performance of that model can server as an indication of the quality of the clusters. \n",
    "\n",
    "In our problem we want to cluster movie represented by their tags: sparse binary vectors. It may make sense to use a [Hamming or L1 loss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_distance) then a euclidean loss. We will see below that the results are actually quite robust regardless of which loss we use."

    "- What would you suggest to obtain better clusters? \n",
    "- One possibility is to represent movies by their genres. It is likely that there many fewer genres than tags. As such, the clustering could be more meaningful. One could get the best of both worlds by using both tags and genres to cluster movies. Run and analyze such a clustering. \n"

    "\n",
    "- This empirical distribution looks symmetrical so there doesn't seem to be a bias toward lower or higher predictions\n",
    "- The prediction errors seem to show that movies and users with more data have smaller prediction error (i.e., the data forms a triangle pointing up). This is intuitive, the more data you have about an item the more accurate should be the estimation of its parameters ($\\theta_{\\text{mid}}$). This could also be reinforced by the fact that we are splitting ratings randomly for train and test (versus splitting by user or item). Hence, popular movies and high-activity users have a great influence in the learning process."

Take this with a grain of salt because it is hardware dependant.

    "- In addition, we use a second regularizer called `early-stopping`. Learning the parameters of a neural network is done iteratively using a method called gradient descent (as opposed to linear regression, there is not analytical solution for the parameters given the objective function). Early stopping simply evaluates validation error after each iteration. It stops learning when validation error stops improving. This can happen before the training loss converges. When it does not, then this regularizer has no effect on learning. In `scikit-learn`, the MLPRegressor class with `early_stopping=True` automatically splits a validation set from the training set to be used by this regularizer. The disadvantage of course is that this reduces the amount of data used to fit parameters. \n",
